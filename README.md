# PlatinumPriceDynamics
ðŸ“Š Platinum Price Dynamics: A data analysis project utilizing SQL and Python to explore the relationship between platinum prices, production, and demand. A step towards future analysis involving advanced modeling and machine learning.

### Prerequisites and Setup
##### IBM DB2 Cloud Account: 
The data retrieval portion of the code requires access to the IBM DB2 Cloud Database and uses SQL queries to retrieve data.
##### Credentials: 
Your IBM DB2 Cloud credentials (username, password, etc.) are necessary to access the database. Please ensure to replace the dummy credentials in the code with your actual IBM DB2 credentials (setting environment variables on your computer).
##### Python Environment: 
Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries.

### Data Retrieval:
##### Using IBM DB2 Cloud:
Navigate to the data retrieval section in the code.
Replace placeholder IBM DB2 credentials with your actual credentials.
Run the code blocks to retrieve and process the data.
##### Using Provided .CSV Files:
If you do not have access to IBM DB2 Cloud, .CSV files have been provided in the /data directory of this repository.
Proceed to run the code with the provided data.

### Running the Analysis:
Once the data is retrieved via IBM DB2 or loaded from the provided .CSV files:
Run subsequent code blocks/notebook cells for data analysis and visualization.

### Note
Ensure all file paths and credentials are set appropriately before running the code.
Follow the comments and instructions in the code/notebook for a smooth execution of the project.
